# Test Instructions for SmartSchool ZIP Extension

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ FIXED: File Extensions Lost
**Problem**: File extensions were being lost during download process
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced filename detection with 3-tier priority system
- Separated folder path from filename to preserve folder structure
- Only apply filename improvements to the actual filename, not the full path

### 2. ✅ FIXED: Folder Structure Not Preserved
**Problem**: Folder structure was being destroyed when filename improvements were applied
**Solution**:
- Split `file.pathInZip` into folder path and filename
- Apply filename improvements only to the filename part
- Reconstruct the full path: `folderPath + improvedFilename`

### 3. ✅ IMPROVED: Progress Bar Stability
**Problem**: Progress bar sometimes disappeared during download, button flashed back briefly
**Solution**:
- Implemented robust state management with `downloadInProgress` flag
- Added proper timeout handling to prevent race conditions
- Removed conflicting completion messages from onclick handler
- Added fallback timeout (30s) in case progress updates stop
- Progress updates now properly control visibility without conflicts

### 4. ✅ IMPROVED: Download Button UI
**Previous work**: Button is now properly styled and positioned

## How to Test

### Step 1: Reload Extension
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "SmartSchool ZIP Downloader"
3. Click the refresh/reload button

### Step 2: Test on SmartSchool
1. Navigate to a SmartSchool course page with files
2. Look for the "Download All as ZIP" button at the top of the file list
3. Click the button

### Step 3: Verify Fixes

#### Test File Extensions:
- Check downloaded ZIP file
- Verify files have proper extensions (.pdf, .docx, .xlsx, etc.)
- Compare with original filenames on the website

#### Test Folder Structure:
- Extract the ZIP file
- Verify folder hierarchy matches the course structure
- Check that files are in correct subfolders

#### Test Progress Bar:
- Watch the button area during download
- Should show: "Starting download..." → "Downloading: filename (x/y)" → "✓ Download completed!"
- Check browser console (F12) for detailed progress logs

### Step 4: Debug Issues

If problems persist, open browser console (F12) and look for:
- `[ContentScript]` messages for UI updates
- `[BackgroundScript]` messages for progress forwarding  
- `[Offscreen]` messages for file downloading

## Expected Console Output

```
[ContentScript] Sending 'downloadZip' message to background script for URL: ...
[BackgroundScript] Received downloadZip request for URL: ...
[Offscreen] Starting ZIP creation with X files
[Offscreen] Downloading file 1/X: filename
[BackgroundScript] Sending progress update: 1/X - Downloading: filename (1/X)
[ContentScript] Progress update received: 1/X - Downloading: filename (1/X)
...
[Offscreen] ZIP download completed successfully
[ContentScript] Progress update received: X/X - Download completed!
```

## Files Modified

1. **offscreen.js**: Fixed filename/folder structure logic
2. **content.js**: Enhanced progress display and error handling
3. **background.js**: Improved message forwarding with error handling

## Key Improvements

- **Filename Resolution**: Now preserves folder structure while improving filenames
- **Progress Tracking**: More reliable with error handling and acknowledgments
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and fallbacks throughout
- **User Experience**: Better visual feedback and button behavior
