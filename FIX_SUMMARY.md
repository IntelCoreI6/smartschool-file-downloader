# SmartSchool Chrome Extension - Duplicate Download Fix Summary

## Problem Solved
The extension was downloading duplicate files because it was scanning for both download button types (green download buttons and regular download links) simultaneously, detecting the same files twice.

## Root Cause
The file selector `'div.name > a.js-download-link[href*="/Documents/Download/"], div.name > a.smsc_cm_link[href*="/Documents/Download/"]'` was finding the same files through both:
1. Green download buttons (`a.js-download-link`)
2. Regular download links (`a.smsc_cm_link`)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Architecture Refactor ✅
- **Before**: Background script fetches files → Creates ZIP → Converts to base64 → Sends to offscreen → Downloads
- **After**: Background script collects URLs → Sends URLs to offscreen → Offscreen fetches files + creates ZIP + downloads directly

### 2. Deduplication Logic ✅
In `offscreen.js`, added URL-based deduplication:
```javascript
const uniqueFileLinks = [];
const seenUrls = new Set();

for (const fileLink of fileLinks) {
  if (!seenUrls.has(fileLink.absoluteUrl)) {
    seenUrls.add(fileLink.absoluteUrl);
    uniqueFileLinks.push(fileLink);
  } else {
    console.log(`Duplicate file URL detected and skipped: ${fileLink.absoluteUrl}`);
  }
}
```

### 3. Eliminated Serialization Issues ✅
- Moved JSZip library from background.js to offscreen.html
- ZIP creation now happens entirely in offscreen context
- No more large data transfer through Chrome messaging

### 4. Enhanced Progress Tracking ✅
- Real-time progress updates: Offscreen → Background → Content Script
- Status messages for each download phase
- Error handling with descriptive messages

## Files Modified

### `offscreen.html`
- Added JSZip library: `<script src="jszip.min.js"></script>`

### `offscreen.js` 
- **NEW**: `createAndDownloadZip()` function for complete ZIP workflow
- **NEW**: URL deduplication logic using `Set` to track `absoluteUrl`
- **NEW**: Direct file fetching, ZIP creation, and download in offscreen context
- **FIXED**: Syntax errors in try-catch blocks
- **ENHANCED**: Real-time progress updates

### `background.js`
- **REMOVED**: JSZip import and ZIP creation logic
- **CHANGED**: Now sends file URL arrays via `createAndDownloadZip` action
- **ADDED**: `progressUpdate` message handler to forward progress to content script
- **SIMPLIFIED**: Focus on URL collection and message routing

## Benefits Achieved

1. **No More Duplicate Downloads**: URL deduplication prevents the same file from being downloaded twice
2. **Better Performance**: No large data transfer through Chrome messaging
3. **Improved Memory Usage**: ZIP creation happens in dedicated offscreen context
4. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Individual file errors don't stop the entire process
5. **Real-time Feedback**: Users see progress updates during download

## Validation
- ✅ No syntax errors in any files
- ✅ Deduplication logic properly implemented
- ✅ JSZip library correctly included in offscreen.html
- ✅ Progress update flow: Offscreen → Background → Content Script
- ✅ File selector covers both green buttons and regular links
- ✅ Error handling for failed individual downloads

## Testing Recommendations
1. Load the extension in Chrome developer mode
2. Navigate to a SmartSchool course with downloadable files
3. Verify the same file appears only once in the generated ZIP
4. Check browser console for deduplication log messages
5. Confirm download progress updates appear correctly

The extension should now download each file exactly once, eliminating the duplicate download issue while providing better performance and user experience.
