3. **Zipping** (Purple): Progress bar for ZIP creation
4. **Completed** (Gold): Success state with glow animation

## **üì± USAGE**

### **Multiple Downloads**
1. Open multiple SmartSchool course pages in different tabs

3. Click extension icon to see all downloads in popup
4. Watch real-time progress for each download
5. Downloads complete independently

### **Progress Monitoring**
- Each download shows current phase and progress
- File counts and percentages for download/zip phases
- Estimated completion based on current progress
- Error states clearly indicated

## **üîß TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Test Scenarios**
1. **Single Download**: Verify basic functionality still works
2. **Multiple Downloads**: Start 2-3 downloads simultaneously
3. **Browser Restart**: Ensure downloads persist in storage
4. **Error Handling**: Test with invalid URLs or network issues
5. **Popup Interaction**: Open/close popup during active downloads

### **Expected Behavior**
- Each download operates independently
- Popup shows real-time progress for all downloads
- Completed downloads can be cleared from popup
- No interference between concurrent downloads
- Graceful handling of errors and timeouts

## **üéØ BENEFITS**

1. **Productivity**: Download from multiple courses simultaneously
2. **Visibility**: Clear overview of all download progress
3. **Reliability**: Individual download isolation prevents cascading failures
4. **User Experience**: Beautiful, intuitive interface with real-time feedback
5. **Performance**: Concurrent processing reduces total download time

## **‚ö° PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS**

- Each download uses its own offscreen document context
- Background script efficiently manages multiple download states
- Storage updates are batched to minimize I/O
- UI updates are throttled to prevent excessive re-renders
- Memory cleanup for completed downloads

The implementation successfully transforms the extension from a single-download tool into a powerful multi-download manager with a beautiful, responsive interface.
